Project Proposal: 

Question: Can user US driven search data generated and gathered with Google Trends and Pharmaceutical Companies (that manufactured vaccinations) stock prices with data from hospital utilization data, vaccination data, and flight data help with predicting daily deaths due to Covid-19 10 days in the future?

Use Case: Can supervised machine learning models help make predictions for constrained resources like the healthcare industry to better handle patient caseloads? 

Goal: Build a machine learning model to predict the number of covid deaths based on the google trend of covid related searches.
